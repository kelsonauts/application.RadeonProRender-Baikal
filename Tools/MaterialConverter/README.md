## Material Converter
This tool is intended to convert Baikal scene materials setup specified in `materials.xml` from the "old" version to the UberV2.
### Usage
Run `MaterialConverter -p <path>` where `<path>` is the folder that contains `mapping.xml` and `materials.xml` of the old Baikal version.
### Result
Material Converter will create `<path>/materials_new.xml` which is compatible with UberV2.
